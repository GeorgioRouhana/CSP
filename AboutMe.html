      <p class="w3-large">Interests</p>
      <p> Outside of school and sports, my favorite things to do are hang out with friends or watch some of my favorite tv shows. I have participated in several tournaments around the country through the travel basketabll team that I joined in the freshman year of high school. Along with the sports that I play, I also participate in several volunteer programs at my school as well as at my local church and hospital. My primary goal is to make an imapact in the lives of those who are less fortunate than I am.
